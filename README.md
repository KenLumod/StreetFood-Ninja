# Mini Game from Upcoming Visual Novel Project

This project is a mini-game developed using **Godot 4**. The game serves as a sneak peek into our upcoming visual novel project, featuring a fun and engaging mechanic inspired by popular slicing games.

---

## Overview

### Concept
- The mini-game is similar to **Fruit Ninja**, but with a twist! Instead of slicing fruits, players control an avatar that moves left, right, jumps, and attacks to slice enemies.
- Enemies include Filipino-inspired street food items: **kwek-kwek**, **fishball**, and **tempura**.

### Current State
- **Work in Progress**: The game is functional but lacks a menu system.
- **Placeholder Assets**: Credit to [anokolisa](https://anokolisa.itch.io/sidescroller-pixelart-sprites-asset-pack-forest-16x16) for the avatar sprite used as a placeholder.
